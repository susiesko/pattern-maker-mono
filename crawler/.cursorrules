# Cursor AI Rules (Python-Specific)

- Always follow PEP8 for style and naming.
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods; PascalCase for classes.
- Use type hints for all new functions and methods.
- Prefer Black for formatting and isort for imports.
- Use pytest for all new tests unless the project is already using unittest.
- Add or update tests for any code changes.
- Use exceptions for error handling, not return codes.
- Never catch broad Exception unless you re-raise or log it.
- Don’t add new Python dependencies without user approval.
- Refactor files > 300 lines into smaller modules.
- Place business logic in modules, not in scripts.
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes.
- Never hardcode secrets or config—use environment variables or config files.
- Never overwrite .env or secrets files.
- If a user requests a “gross” Python anti-pattern, warn them but do it if they insist
